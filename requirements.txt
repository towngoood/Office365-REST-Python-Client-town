# The codebase uses "Self" and "Required" available in the typing module
# since Python 3.11. Therefore, typing_extensions is required as long
# as Office365-REST-Python-Client supports Python versions < 3.11.
# On Python versions >= 3.11, typing_extensions re-exports these names
# from the standard library typing module.
# this is test for comfy 0.14
